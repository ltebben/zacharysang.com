# About Me

## Who I am
Hello! My name is Zachary Sang (in the blue shirt) and I'm a Computer Science Major at the 
University of Cincinnati (Graduating Spring 2019). I'm a third year student at UC who moved to 
Cincinnati from Hong Kong for my first year of college. I have always been interested in solving 
problems and using my skills to improve the world around me. In addition to this, I also hold a deep 
interest in computers, how they work and how they can be creatively applied to solve issues and inefficiencies. 
Because of this, I'm very glad that I chose computer science as a major because it allows  me to create new things 
while also continuously learning about technology, computing and how to use these tools to solve exciting and fascinating problems.

## What I'm Good At
From growing up in Hong Kong, I have become skilled at interacting with people of all different personalities, 
cultures and backgrounds. This makes me a great team member, a strong communicator and a very effective collaborator. 
Some of my primary technical skills include Python, Java and general HTML/CSS knowledge. However, I have also recently 
become very interested in web development and so have begun to learn about node.js, express.js, Bootstrap and jQuery. 
Additionally, I have also been learning about the use of Jekyll with github pages in order to make this site!
