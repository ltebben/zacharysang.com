RevolutionUC is UC's premier hackathon event that hosts over 200 people. The aim of this event is to bring together high school and university students 
who are interested in creating new things with technology. This event provides a platform for these people to experiment with new tools, network with 
industry professionals and to collaborate with one another.

For fall 2016's event, I was primarily involved with speaking to company representatives about sponsorship (We are funded solely through sponsors to 
eliminate the need for a registration fee and to minimize any barriers to entry for participation in this event). As a part of this role, I was responsible 
for maintaining contact with sponsors and working with them to get them involved to maximize benefit for the sponsors, our participants and the event as a whole. 

Although my main focus was bringing sponsorship to RevUC, I feel that I was able to learn a great deal in general from being a part of the organization 
team for this large scale event. I certainly learnt a lot about collaboration over a longer period of time from working with this team for several months 
leading up to this event.


## Bearcat Buddies (January 2016 - Present)

Bearcat Buddies is a program run at the University of Cincinnati in co-ordination with Cincinnati Public schools that matches university 
students to elementary school students. The goal of this program is not only to provide academic support for these students in the form of 
tutoring, but also to provide general support by meeting with them regularly and building a relationship with them. Being a Bearcat Buddies tutor has been a 
highly rewarding experience for numerous reasons, I have been able to work with some great kids and have also been able to learn to act as a role model figure.


## Cincinnati Observatory Assistant (September 2015 - September 2016)

The Cincinnati Observatory Center is a historical landmark that holds historical significance not only for the City of Cincinnati, but also for various 
areas in the science community. In addition to being home to the oldest operating professional telescope, the COC also happens to be the location of 
President John Quincy Adamsâ€™ final public speech, where he inaugurated this facility's new location on the former Mt. Ida, now named Mt. Adams in honor 
of President Adams and his speech here. In addition to this, Cleveland Abbe, a former director of the COC, was a meteorologist who hugely contributed to 
the science of weather forecasting. In fact, after his time at the COC, Abbe continued to become founder of the National Weather Service.

My role at the Observatory was to act as a knowledgeable authority to the general public and to be ready to answer questions about not only the history 
of the observatory, but also about the science of astronomy. I was also responsible for assisting the Observatory Speaker by managing equipment and 
facilities at the Observatory, and also to help co-ordinate and guide our guests around the center. Through this role I was able to develop skills with 
working with people and meeting the needs of our guests. I was also able to gain valuable knowledge about astronomy and about this place that holds so 
much interesting history.
