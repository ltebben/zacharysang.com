# Experience

## Siemens PLM Software (Java Developer, August 2015 - August 2016)

My first and second co-op terms took place in the Fall of 2015 and the Summer of 2016. 
For these semesters, I worked as a developer for Siemens PLM on their AKS team. AKS is a 
large-scale web application that is used to document and manage business and manufacturing 
processes. During my first semester, I worked heavily on building a utility that would automate 
the QA teamâ€™s testing of this web application. Our team used the Selenium web-driver alongside 
Cucumber with Java to allow the non-technical QA team to write automated tests in a near-English 
language. These tests would then be able to be executed by the web-driver and results would be 
recorded for later reference. As a part of this project, I learned a lot about web-drivers and 
also about Cucumber and how it uses regex to capture phrases and map them to Java code. Additionally, 
through this experience I was able to greatly expand my familiarity with HTML and CSS.

During my second semester, I worked on building a utility in Python that would compare a tree 
structure displayed through a web application to a baseline from an excel document. We used Python 
to extract the data from the baseline excel document and to put this data along with the extracted 
values from the web application into XML format for simple comparison. In addition to this project, 
during this semester I was also able to begin to develop skills in JavaScript, JQuery and with SVG 
to build a tool that allowed a user to create diagrams within their web browser. I found this portion 
of my work to be highly interesting and I have since developed an interest in learning more about 
JavaScript and web development in general.

## Trust Lab (Team Member, January 2016 - May 2016)
During the spring semester of 2016, me and a classmate worked together to help a professor with a 
project that he was involved in. Our work was centered around Git and involved storing information 
about repositories such as their age, activity and commit history. We were to build a utility that 
would flexibly generate a dataset that our professor could then use for his study. Over the course 
of this project, I learned about Python as well as how to use Git to develop collaboratively. I 
believe that this experience was extremely valuable for me because it pushed me to learn more about 
Python, which I now see as a very powerful, versatile and familiar language. I also feel that this 
experience was particularly valuable for learning Git; this is because not only did we use Git for 
collaboration within our team, but we also learned a lot about Git for the purposes of understanding 
what data we would be able to extract from Git, and anticipating what data could potentially be 
meaningful for our professor.

## Velocity Business Solutions (Intern, May 2015 - July 2015)

Over the summer of 2015 I worked at Velocity Business Solutions, a company that specializes in 
business intelligence. VBS was a provider of the Qlikview software suite and they give their customers 
insight into data by helping them to analyze and process the data in numerous new ways using this 
software. My primary role as part of this team was to begin development of a SQL database to manage 
Velocity's customers and the data they handled. The database would store and manage the permissions 
associated with this data. In addition to working with this, I also worked on a basic HTML web 
application that served as an interface through which the data in the database could be modified. 
From this experience, I was able to learn about SQL and about the basics of databases. I was also 
able to begin to gain some insight into web applications and what is involved with their development. 
From working on this web application, I began to see web applications as a highly versatile, and very 
powerful tool.
