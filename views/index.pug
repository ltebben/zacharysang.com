            | Hello! My name is Zachary Sang (in the blue shirt) and I’m a Computer 
            | Science Major at the University of Cincinnati (Graduating Spring 2019). 
            | I’m a third year student at UC who moved to Cincinnati from Hong Kong for my 
            | first year of college. I have always been interested in solving problems and 
            | using my skills to improve things around me. I also 
            | hold a deep interest in computers, how they work, and how they can be used creatively 
            | to solve issues and inefficiencies. Because of all this, I’m very glad that 
            | I was able to find myself as a CS major because it allows me to create while 
            | continuously learning about technology and solving exciting and fascinating problems.

                |At my time at Siemens I worked as a developer for Siemens PLM on their Active Knowledge Sharing (AKS) team.
                | AKS is a web application that helps tracking and managing business and manufacturing processes. 
                |During my first semester, I worked heavily on building a utility that would automate the QA team’s 
                |testing of this web application. Our team used the Selenium web-driver alongside Cucumber with Java 
                |to allow the non-technical QA team to write automated tests in a near-English language. These tests 
                |would then be able to be executed by the web-driver and results would be recorded for later reference.
