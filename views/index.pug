        p of 2016. For these semesters, I worked as a developer for Siemens PLM on their AKS team. AKS is a large-scale web application that is used to document and manage business and manufacturing processes. During my first semester, I worked heavily on building a utility that would automate the QA teamâ€™s testing of this web application. Our team used the Selenium web-driver alongside Cucumber with Java to allow the non-technical QA team to write automated tests in a near-English language. These tests would then be able to be executed by the web-driver and results would be recorded for later reference. As a part of this project, I learned a lot about web-drivers and also about Cucumber and how it uses regex to capture phrases and map them to Java code. Additionally, through this experience I was able to greatly expand my familiarity with HTML and CSS.
